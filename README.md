# RNA Prediction Modification

![RNA Molecule](RNAModXApp/images/rna-img.png)

Welcome to the RNA Prediction Modification project! This repository aims to provide an introduction and guide to understanding RNA prediction modification using our solution. This project is designed by us, the RNAModX team, to help you predict if the RNA sequence is modified, and the position of the RNA Modification.

## Introduction to RNA Prediction

RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) is a vital molecule involved in various biological processes, including gene expression, regulation, and protein synthesis.

## Getting Started

Before you dive into RNA prediction and modification, make sure you have a clear understanding of the prerequisites and installation steps.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this project, you'll need:

- Basic understanding of molecular biology concepts.
- Familiarity with programming and command-line tools (ie. Powershell).
- A code editor (Intellij or Visual Studio) for viewing and editing scripts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using: https://github.com/shashivish/RNA-ModX.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: RNAModXApp
3. Install the required libraries and dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the command: streamlit run main.py

## Architecture
The solution is:

## Example

1. The UI looks like this: ![UI](RNAModXApp/images/ui-original.png)
2. Key in RNA sequence: GGGGCCGTGGATACCTGCCTTTTAATTCTTTTTTATTCGCCCATCGGGGCCGCGGATACCTGCTTTTTATTTTTTTTTCCTTAGCCCATCGGGGTATCGGATACCTGCTGATTCCCTTCCCCTCTGAACCCCCAACACTCTGGCCCATCGGGGTGACGGATATCTGCTTTTTAAAAATTTTCTTTTTTTGGCCCATCGGGGCTTCGGATA
3. Click 'Predict'
4. Results look like this: ![Results-1](RNAModXApp/images/results-1.png)
   ![Results-2](RNAModXApp/images/results-2.png)
5. Click on 'Download Excel' to view the results in excel file

## Results Interpretation
The result for each position is displayed in the UI, as shown below:
![Results-interpreation](RNAModXApp/images/results-interpretation.png)
The index refers to the position of the nucleotide in the sequence
Eg. 51

In the 51st position, the nucleotide predicted to be modified is C.
At the 51st position, the modification type could be either hCm or hm5C. 

51-binary is the final class binary prediction results (ie. Final layer of the architecture diagram)
51-multi is the multi-class prediction of which class the nucleotide belongs to.
51-final is the multiplication of 51-binary and 51-multi.
